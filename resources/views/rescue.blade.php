				<li>- Before report a case to AFJ, please make sure you have prepared camera to take pictures and(or) record videos and do your own private investigation to find about the truth</li>
				<li>- Share us the photos / videos along with the background of the case</li>
				<li>- Don't forget to include your real name, phone number, address, and email so we can contact you back and make sure you are a real person</li>
				<li>- You can't just report a case and then dissapear. You have to accompany us during the whole process, it includes (if needed): location visit, rescue stage, adoption / fostering stage</li>
				<li>- Please understand that the moment you report a case, it means you have a full responsibility to participate in the case</li>
				<li>- We have only few people to work on reported case so we can't process all the incoming case neither directly response to you</li>
				<li>- In this case, we need you to be pro-active by self-awareness act and try to be patient, consultate with us if you don't know what to do. We will give you a contact person.</li>
				<li>- Think about solutions and what's the best for the animals will always keep you strong. Cheers !!!</li>
